# any-language-frames
Multilingual datasets for the paper "Any-language frame-semantic parsing".
The project contains three directories:

1.  /annotated/ contains the directories with annotated files, named following a ```language_annotator```convention.
2.  /preannotated/ contains the pre-annotated files, with the FrameNet+BabelNet frame labels the annotators had to choose from.
3.  /preprocessed/ contains the preprocessed files, with POS and dependency trees predicted using TreeTagger (Schmid,1995) and TurboParser (Martins et al, 2010) on Universal Dependencies v1.1.
